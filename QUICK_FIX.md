# 🚨 QUICK FIX - Database 500 Errors

## The Problem
Your backend returns **500 errors** because **your database is EMPTY**. The server is running but has no data to return!

## ⚡ FASTEST FIX (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Using the Shell Script (Easiest)

1. **Open Terminal** and navigate to backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/georgekasiyandima/Holy Cross Convent School Brooklyn/backend"
   ```

2. **Set your production DATABASE_URL:**
   
   Get this from your Render Dashboard → Database Service → "External Database URL"
   
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url-from-render"
   ```

3. **Make script executable and run it:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x seed-production.sh
   ./seed-production.sh
   ```

   That's it! ✅
