## Understanding the System

### **Categories vs Albums vs Tags**

1. **Categories** (High-level classification):
   - `EVENTS` - General school events and celebrations
   - `SPORTS` - Sports activities, matches, competitions
   - `ACADEMIC` - Academic achievements, competitions, book-related
   - `CULTURAL` - Cultural celebrations, heritage events
   - `GENERAL` - Miscellaneous photos

2. **Albums** (Organizational containers):
   - Albums group related photos together
   - Format: `[Event Name] [Year]` (e.g., "Heritage Day 2025")
   - Each album can contain multiple photos
   - Albums appear as cards on the public gallery

3. **Tags** (Additional metadata):
   - Comma-separated keywords for searchability
   - Examples: "heritage day, cultural, celebration, 2025"
   - Helps with filtering and searching

## Best Practices

### **1. Consistent Naming**
- Always include the year in album names: `[Event Name] [Year]`
- Use consistent capitalization (e.g., "Heritage Day" not "heritage day")
- Keep event names consistent across years

### **2. Category Selection**
- Choose the category that best describes the event's primary purpose
- If unsure, use `EVENTS` as it's the most general category
- Cultural celebrations → `CULTURAL`
- Sports activities → `SPORTS`
- Academic activities → `ACADEMIC`

### **3. Album Organization**
- Create one album per event per year
- Don't mix years in the same album
- Use descriptive album names that include the event and year

### **4. Tags**
- Use consistent tags across photos in the same album
- Include the event name, category, and year in tags
- Add additional descriptive tags for better searchability

### **5. Yearly Events**
- Each year, create a new album for recurring events
- Example:
  - 2024: "Heritage Day 2024"
  - 2025: "Heritage Day 2025"
  - 2026: "Heritage Day 2026"

## Troubleshooting

### **Q: Which category should I use for a new event?**
A: Consider the primary purpose:
- Celebration of culture/heritage → `CULTURAL`
- General school celebration → `EVENTS`
- Sports/physical activity → `SPORTS`
- Academic/learning activity → `ACADEMIC`
- If unsure → `EVENTS`

### **Q: Can I change an event's category later?**
A: Yes, you can edit individual photos and change their category, but it's better to be consistent from the start.

### **Q: Should I create a new album each year?**
A: Yes! Create a new album for each year (e.g., "Heritage Day 2024", "Heritage Day 2025"). This keeps photos organized and makes it easy to find photos from specific years.

### **Q: What if an event doesn't fit the templates?**
A: No problem! You can manually create an album with any name. The templates are just shortcuts for common events.
