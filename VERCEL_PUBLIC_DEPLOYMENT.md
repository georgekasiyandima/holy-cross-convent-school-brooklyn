# üåê Making Your Vercel Site Publicly Accessible

## **Problem**
Your Vercel deployment requires GitHub authentication to view, preventing the school from accessing the website.

## **Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Check Vercel Project Settings (Most Common Fix)**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Select Your Project**
   - Find "Holy Cross Convent School Brooklyn" project
   - Click on it

3. **Check Visibility Settings**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
   - Look for **"Visibility"** section
   - Ensure it's set to **"Public"** (not "Private")

4. **Get Production URL**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click on the **Production** deployment (not Preview)
   - Copy the URL (e.g., `https://holy-cross-convent-school-brooklyn-xxx.vercel.app`)

### **Solution 2: Verify GitHub Repository Settings**

1. **Go to GitHub Repository**
   - Visit your repository on GitHub
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General**

2. **Check Repository Visibility**
   - Ensure it's set to **"Public"**
   - If it's private, make it public or the Vercel deployment might be restricted

### **Solution 3: Redeploy with Public Settings**

1. **Push Updated Configuration**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update Vercel config for public access"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger New Deployment**
   - Vercel will automatically redeploy
   - The new deployment should be publicly accessible

### **Solution 4: Use Vercel CLI (Alternative Method)**

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy with Public Access**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel --prod --public
   ```

3. **Get the URL**
   - The CLI will provide a public URL
   - Share this URL with the school

### **Solution 5: Create Custom Domain (Professional Option)**

1. **In Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
   - Click **"Add Domain"**

2. **Add Custom Domain**
   - Enter: `holycrossbrooklyn.edu`
   - Or: `www.holycrossbrooklyn.edu`

3. **Configure DNS**
   - Follow Vercel's DNS instructions
   - This gives you a professional URL

## **Testing Public Access**

### **Before Sharing with School:**

1. **Test in Incognito/Private Mode**
   - Open the URL in a private browser window
   - Ensure no login is required

2. **Test from Different Device**
   - Try accessing from your phone (not connected to your WiFi)
   - Use mobile data to simulate external access

3. **Test Key Pages**
   - Homepage loads correctly
   - Navigation works
   - All images and content display properly

## **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue: Still Asking for GitHub Login**
**Fix:** 
- Check if you're using the Production URL (not Preview)
- Ensure repository is public on GitHub
- Wait 5-10 minutes after making changes

### **Issue: Site Shows "404 Not Found"**
**Fix:**
- Check if the build completed successfully in Vercel
- Verify the build directory is set to `frontend/build`
- Check for build errors in Vercel dashboard

### **Issue: Images or Assets Not Loading**
**Fix:**
- Check if all static files are in the `frontend/build` directory
- Verify the `vercel.json` routes are correct
- Ensure file paths are relative, not absolute

## **Final Checklist**

Before sharing with the school:

- [ ] Site loads without authentication
- [ ] All pages are accessible
- [ ] Images and assets load correctly
- [ ] Navigation works properly
- [ ] Mobile version looks good
- [ ] Contact information is visible
- [ ] School branding is correct

## **Sharing with School**

Once everything works:

   - Include a brief description of what they can find

2. **Provide Access Instructions**
   - "Simply click the link to view our website"
   - "No login required - it's publicly accessible"
   - "Works on computers, tablets, and phones"

3. **Test Period**
