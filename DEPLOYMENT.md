```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to verify the build works correctly.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `frontend/build`
4. Configure environment variables if needed
5. Deploy

### Option 2: Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set framework preset to "Create React App"
3. Set root directory to `frontend`
4. Deploy

### Option 3: Traditional Web Hosting
